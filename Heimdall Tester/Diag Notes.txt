 The laymans version.
 Everyone connected is connected to a Heimdall.
 Any command that affects you as a character, happens in Heimdall.
 Every dream you go in, is a tribble.
 There are hundreds.
 Any command that affects a map, or people on a map, happens in Tribble.
 Horton, there is one (per world)
 Horton makes sure Heimdalls can talk to each other, and to the tribble.
 Thats not totally accurate, as Cat is no doubt going to say - but it's a good TLDR easy to follow version. It's true, to a degree of true.

 If a Heimdall breaks 1/6th of players are affected badly. If it hangs, 1/6th attempts to login fail. If we kill one, 1/6th of all players disconnect, the Heimdall restarts itself.
 If a Tribble hangs or crashes, a map is broken, players cannot get into it or act inside it. If it is killed, the map restarts - and the dream loads into a new tribble process.
 If Horton hangs, crshes or is killed, it's brown trousers time. Server restarts.
